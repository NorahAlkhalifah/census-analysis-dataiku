    "\n",
    "This project explores U.S. Census employment and demographic data to uncover trends and relationships within the workforce.  \n",
    " \n",
    "The analysis focuses on identifying patterns across variables such as age, education, and occupation, and preparing the data for a **classification task** aimed at predicting an individual's *income level*.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the Python-based workflow, further exploratory analysis and visualization were conducted in **Dataiku** to enhance interpretability and support data-driven insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "This dataset was extracted from the **U.S. Census Bureau** database available at [https://www.census.gov/data.html](https://www.census.gov/data.html).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The data is used to study **income classification**, where the goal is to predict whether an individual's income exceeds **$50K per year**, based on demographic and employment attributes.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "It includes **40 attributes** (7 continuous, 33 categorical) covering features such as **age, education, occupation, class of worker,** and **hours worked**, with income level serving as the **target variable**.\n",
